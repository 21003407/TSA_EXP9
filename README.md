# EX.NO.09         IMPLEMENTATION OF ARIMA MODEL
### Date: 

### AIM:
To Implement ARIMA model using python
### ALGORITHM:
1. Explore the dataset
2. Check for stationarity of time series
time series plot
ACF plot and PACF plot
ADF test
Transform to stationary: differencing
3. Determine ARIMA models parameters p, q
4. Fit the ARIMA model
5. Make time series predictions
Auto-fit the ARIMA model
6. Evaluate model predictions
### PROGRAM:

### OUTPUT:


### RESULT:
Thus the program run successfully based on the ARIMA model using python.
